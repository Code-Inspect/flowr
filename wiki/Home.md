***This wiki page is currently under construction***

*flowR* is a static [dataflow analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) and [program slicer](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr/wiki/Terminology#program-slice) for the [*R*](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language (currently tested for versions `4.x`), and you have stumbled upon its wiki pages!

Overall, the wiki has three goals:

1. Illustrate how to [**use**](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr/wiki/Overview) *flowR* in its current form.
2. Show how to [**extend**](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr/wiki/Interface) *flowR* with other tools (i.e., how to interface with *flowR*)
3. Explain the inner workings to help to [**develop**](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr/wiki/Core) *flowR*'s core.

Hence, depending on your needs and interest, only a subset of the wiki pages may be of further interest to you.
Nevertheless, we highly recommend you start your journey by reading the [Overview](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr/wiki/Overview) wiki page, which explains the main features of *flowR* and how to use them.
