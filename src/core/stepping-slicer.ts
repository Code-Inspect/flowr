/**
 * This is ultimately the root of flowR's static slicing procedure.
 * It clearly defines the steps that are to be executed and splits them into two stages.
 * - `once-per-file`: for steps that are executed once per file. These can be performed *without* the knowledge of a slicing criteria,
 *   and they can be cached and re-used if you want to slice the same file multiple times.
 * - `once-per-slice`: for steps that are executed once per slice. These can only be performed *with* a slicing criteria.
 *
 * Furthermore, this stepper follows an iterable fashion to be *as flexible as possible* (e.g., to be instrumented with measurements).
 * So, you can use the stepping slicer like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const slicer = new SteppingSlicer({ ... })
 * while(slicer.hasNextStep()) {
 *     await slicer.nextStep()
 * }
 *
 * slicer.switchToSliceStage()
 *
 * while(slicer.hasNextStep()) {
 *     await slicer.nextStep()
 * }
 *
 * const result = slicer.getResults()
 * ```
 *
 * Of course, you might think, that this is rather overkill if you simply want to receive the slice of a given input source or in general
 * the result of any step. And this is true. Therefore, if you do not want to perform some kind of magic in-between steps, you can use the
 * **{@link allRemainingSteps}** function like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const slicer = new SteppingSlicer({ ... })
 * const result = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * As the name suggest, you can combine this name with previous calls to {@link nextStep} to only execute the remaining steps.
 *
 * Giving the **step of interest** allows you to declare the maximum step to execute.
 * So, if you pass `dataflow` as the step of interest, the stepping slicer will stop after the dataflow step.
 * If you do not pass a step, the stepping slicer will execute all steps.
 *
 * By default, the {@link SteppingSlicer} does not offer an automatic way to repeat the per-slice steps for multiple slices (this is mostly to prevent accidental errors).
 * However, you can use the **{@link updateCriterion}** function to reset the per-slice steps and re-execute them for a new slice. This allows something like the following:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const slicer = new SteppingSlicer({ ... })
 * const result = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
 *
 * slicer.updateCriterion(...)
 * const result2 = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * @note Even though, using the stepping slicer introduces some performance overhead, we consider
 * it to be the baseline for performance benchmarking. It may very well be possible to squeeze out some more performance by
 * directly constructing the steps in the right order. However, we consider this to be negligible when compared with the time required
 * for, for example, the dataflow analysis.
 *

 * @see StepName
