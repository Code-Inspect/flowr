/**
 * This file defines *all* steps of the slicing process and the data they require.
 *
 * Note, that the order of elements here also describes the *desired* order of their desired execution for readability.
 * However, it is the {@link SteppingSlicer} which controls the order of execution and the steps required to achieve a given result.
 *
 * If you add a new step, you have to (at least) update the {@link SteppingSlicer} as well as the corresponding type predicate {@link SteppingSlicerInput}.
 * Furthermore, if your step is the new *last* step, please update {@link LAST_STEP}.
 *
 * Please note that the combination of `satisfies` and `as` seems to be required.
 * With `satisfies` we make sure that the respective element has all the keys it requires, and the `as` force the type to be exactly the given one
